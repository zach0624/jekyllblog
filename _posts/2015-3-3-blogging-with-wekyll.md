The original iteration of this site was what I thought would be a simple wordpress blog.
  At the time I was still in school and though \"I know PHP and Wordpress will be easy to setup and get running.
  I know enough about html and css to write my own theme and enough about administration to manage my own blog.\"
  It started off great, Wordpress was very easy to set up and I immeadiately had a new theme installed.
  My website was beautiful.
  Before I knew it I had SEO, commenting, ratings and a hundred other plugins to make my site more powerful.
  For a while life was good.

Until bots starting creating accounts, and spamming the comments section of my website. I installed captchas to prevent this and it worked, for a couple of days. Before I knew it the bots were back. I tried a variety of methods including blacklisting IPs and adding a variety of security related plugins. Eventually it got to the point that I was spending a couple hours a day just removing spam comments and with school I no longer had the time to actually post updates. Yes, I could have just disabled commenting and be done with it but what\'s the point of having a blog if no one comments on it right?

**Enter Jekyll**

After working for several months as a Rails developer at my current job I decided to revive my blog and start sharing the lessons I\'ve learned as a developer.  The first decision I made was to dump Wordpress, not because it isn\'t an great bloggin platform but
