				<title>Blogging with Jekyll</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The original iteration of this site was what I thought would be a simple wordpress blog.
  At the time I was still in school and though &quot;I know PHP and Wordpress will be easy to setup and get running.
  I know enough about html and css to write my own theme and enough about administration to manage my own blog.&quot;
  It started off great, Wordpress was very easy to set up and I immeadiately had a new theme installed.
  My website was beautiful.
  Before I knew it I had SEO, commenting, ratings and a hundred other plugins to make my site more powerful.
  For a while life was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until bots starting creating accounts, and spamming the comments section of my website. I installed captchas to prevent this and it worked, for a couple of days. Before I knew it the bots were back. I tried a variety of methods including blacklisting IPs and adding a variety of security related plugins. Eventually it got to the point that I was spending a couple hours a day just removing spam comments and with school I no longer had the time to actually post updates. Yes, I could have just disabled commenting and be done with it but what&#39;s the point of having a blog if no one comments on it right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter Jekyll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After working for several months as a Rails developer at my current job I decided to revive my blog and start sharing the lessons I&#39;ve learned as a developer.  The first decision I made was to dump Wordpress, not because it isn&#39;t an great bloggin platform but&lt;/p&gt;
